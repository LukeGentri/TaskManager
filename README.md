# TaskManager

TaskManager is a simple Java application built using Eclipse IDE. It's a to-do list that allows users to manage tasks through a GUI. Users can add tasks, remove tasks, and mark tasks complete. Users can also sort tasks by due date or name, list completed or incompleted tasks, clear all tasks, and undo any of the previous operations. TaskManager also supports file IO. Users can load a task list from a CSV file and save the current list to a file.
